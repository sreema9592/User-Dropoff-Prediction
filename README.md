# User Drop-Off Prediction System

## 📌 Overview
This project is a Machine Learning–based system that predicts whether a user is likely to stop using an application (user drop-off) based on activity and engagement patterns.  
The system also suggests actionable strategies to improve user retention.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many applications lose users due to inactivity, low engagement, or poor feature usage.  
Identifying such users early helps businesses take preventive actions like notifications, offers, or feature guidance.

## 💡 Solution
This project analyzes user behavior data and predicts drop-off risk using a Logistic Regression model.  
Based on the prediction, the system recommends actions to re-engage users.
